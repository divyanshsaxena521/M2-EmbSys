## Introduction
An embedded system combines mechanical, electrical, and chemical components along with a computer, hidden inside, to perform a single dedicated purpose. 
 
As our world has become more complex, so have the capabilities of the microcontrollers embedded into our devices. Therefore the world needs a trained workforce to develop and manage products based on embedded microcontrollers.
