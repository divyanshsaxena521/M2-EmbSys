# SMART DIGITAL CAMERA
# INTRODUCTION
Cameras that we use today are smart and have a lot of features that were not present in early cameras all because of the embedded system used in them.
A digital camera has basically three functions, to capture an image which we call data, to store image data, and to represent this data.
There is no need for the film for storing images. This feature has increased the storage capacity and made it easy to transfer images.
