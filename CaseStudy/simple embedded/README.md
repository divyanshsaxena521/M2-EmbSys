# DIGITAL THERMOMETER
## INTRODUCTION
 
Digital thermometers are temperature sensing instruments that are easily portable have permanent probes and a convenientdigital display. The way of digital thermometer works depends uponits type. They are a resistance temperature detector, thermocoupledigital or thermistor digital thermometer. With the help of blockdiagrams we can easily understand the construction of digitalthermometer. We use copper constantan as a thermocouple.

# COMPONENTS 

    * THERMOCOUPLE  
    * DC AMPLIFIER
    * ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTER
    * SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAY

## WORKING
The following operational units are used inside microcontroller in the working of the a digital thermometer. 
    * ADDRESS AND RESET UNIT 
    * CONTROL LOGIC STATUS UNIT
    * TEMPERATURE SENSOR UNIT
    * HIGH TEMPERATURE TRIGGER UNIT
    * LOW TEMPERATURE TRIGGER UNIT
    * COMPARATOR LOGIC UNIT.

### ADDRESS AND RESET UNIT
The main function of this unit is to address & store the recent measurements and to reset the device as per user instruction.
 
 ### CONTROL LOGIC STATUS 
 The main fuction of this unit is to receive input information to which it converts into control signals, which are then sent to the central processor. The computer's processor then tells the attached hardware what operations to perform.

 ### TEMPERATURE SENSOR UNIT
 The main fuction of  temperature sensor is  to measure temperature.and sent the data to processor for further processes. This can be air temperature, liquid temperature or the temperature of solid matter.

### COMPARATOR LOGIC UNIT
 The main fuction of this unitis it t takes two inputs and compare the two inputs and produce an output, based on the condition or values of the two inputs.
